## Approach

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Removed null/duplicate entries  
- Fixed date parsing for `Order Date` and `Ship Date`  
- Derived new features: `Year`, `Month`, `Weekday`  
- Ensured proper data types for analysis  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified top-performing segments, categories, and regions  
- Explored `Profit` vs `Discount` trends  
- Uncovered seasonality and purchase behavior over time  
- Created summary tables (e.g., top profitable cities)  

### 3. Dashboard Design with Streamlit
- **Sidebar Menu** with pages:
  - Overview
  - Sales by Category
  - Profit Analysis
  - Segment Trends
- **Interactive Filters**:
  - Date Range
  - Region / Segment / Category
- **Visual Components**:
  - Sales/Profit over time (`line plots`)
  - Region-wise map view (`choropleth`)
  - Category/Sub-category bar charts
  - Segment-based pie charts
  - KPIs (Total Sales, Profit, Orders)
